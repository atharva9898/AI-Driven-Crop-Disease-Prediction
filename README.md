# **AI-Driven Crop Disease Prediction System**  
### *SIH 2024 - Under Development*

---

## **Project Description**

This project is designed to assist farmers in identifying and treating crop diseases using cutting-edge AI technologies. The system analyzes images of crops to predict diseases, provides fertilizer recommendations, and finds nearby stores where the required fertilizer is available.

The project is still under development and will undergo further enhancements to make it more robust and user-friendly. It aims to simplify farming decisions using AI, even for farmers who are not familiar with technology.

## **Key Features**

- **AI-Based Disease Detection:**  
   - Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to analyze crop images and predict diseases accurately.
  
- **Fertilizer Recommendations:**  
   - After identifying the disease, the system suggests suitable fertilizers to mitigate the issue.
  
- **Chatbot with Voice Support:**  
   - A conversational AI chatbot that supports multiple languages and offers voice input/output, making it accessible to farmers in rural areas.
  
- **Store Locator:**  
   - Integrates with SERP AI to find nearby stores where recommended fertilizers are available, providing contact details for easy access.
  
- **Multilingual Support:**  
   - The system supports various regional languages to make it accessible to a wider audience.

## **How to Use (Under Development)**

1. **Upload Image:**  
   Farmers or users will upload an image of the affected crop.
  
2. **Disease Prediction:**  
   The AI model will analyze the image and predict the disease.
  
3. **Fertilizer Recommendation:**  
   Based on the disease, the system will recommend the best fertilizer for treatment.
  
4. **Store Location:**  
   The system will show nearby stores where the fertilizer is available.

5. **Chatbot Interaction:**  
   Users can interact with the chatbot for assistance using text or voice input.
